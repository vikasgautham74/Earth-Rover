# Earth-Rover
       In the era of automation and the Internet of Things (IoT), there's a growing need to create machines that can perform tasks autonomously while still being under remote control for precise tasks. The project at hand, titled "Autonomous Remote-Controlled Rover with Facial Recognition," blends the worlds of automation, remote control, and facial recognition into a single robust system.

       This rover, built on the Raspberry Pi platform, is not just another remotely controlled vehicle. It has the ability to switch between manual and autonomous modes, possesses provides real-time video streaming via the Pi Camera. Furthermore, with the integration of facial recognition, the project opens doors to myriad advanced applications, making it more than just a toy.
